# loshn-koydesh-pronunciation

A mapping of phonetic forms to orthographic forms for Yiddish words from *loshn-koydesh* (Hebrew/Aramaic) -- also known as the "Semitic component."

The lexicon comes from:

Niborski, Yitskhok. 1999. *Verterbukh fun loshn-koydesh-shtamike verter in yidish [Dictionnaire des mots d'origine hébraïque et araméenne en usage dans la langue yiddish/Dictionary of Hebrew- and Aramaic-origin words in Yiddish]*. Paris: Bibliothèque Medem.

The pronunciation list (*fonetisher indeks/shlisl*) was compiled by Eliezer Niborski and published as a PDF here: https://editions.yiddish.paris/dictionnaire-des-mots-dorigine-hebraique/

This repository contains five files:
* The PDF linked above
* A version in RTF, provided by Eliezer Niborski
* A text file adapted from the RTF, containing a clean mapping of phonetic forms to standard orthographic forms (with missing inflections added, typos fixed, etc.)
* A Python script to create a mapping of orthographic forms to phonetic forms, based on above
* The output file from the Python script

Note: the files may inconsistently use pre-combined Unicode characters (e.g., װ versus וו or ױ versus וי, etc.)
